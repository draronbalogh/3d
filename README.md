# 3D Library

## Overview

This project was created as part of my DLA  research, and it was prepared for my doctoral defense presentation with the purpose of testing web 3D models. You'll find a collection of experiments with 3D WebGL and WebGPU libraries such as Three.js and Babylon.js. 

This project is a full-stack application that utilizes the MERN stack, with Node.js and Express.js for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and MySQL for the database. By uploading 3D models, they are stored in a designated folder specified in the configuration and are saved in the database. CRUD operations can be performed on the models, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting them, as well as adding or deleting models to/from folders. 

The 3D models included in the project were created using Blender and are saved as gltf and glb files, which can be viewed directly in the browser. As a work in progress, the project will continue to add more models and experiments in the future. Feedback is welcome, and you are free to contact me with any suggestions on how to improve the project.
